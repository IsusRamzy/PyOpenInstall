## PyOpenInstall | Contribution  
Welcome to the contribution page.

There are two types of contributions in this repository, improving the project itself, or adding a new package.

If you want to add a new package:  
- The source code path will be `/REPO/MODULE`  
- The link will be the link of the zipped module at a specific time (`commit`).  
- You will add a `pull request` to the database file.  
- I will check the module code's saftey, if safe, I'll merge, otherwise, I'll report the account for the unsafe code.  

If you want to improve the package itself:
- You will add a `pull request` to the file.  
- I will check the code's saftey, if safe, I'll merge, otherwise, I'll report the account for the unsafe code.
