### PyOpenInstall
This is an open-source Python mini package-manager to install Python packages.  
***WARNING: This is not a replacment for pip, but an `extension` for it, so you can install modules not bundled in `pip`.***  

Did you find an API not included in the standard Python manager, `pip`?  
PyOpenInstall installs the API for you.  
Or you have a Python module and you want people to install it easily?
[Contribute to PyOpenInstall](CONTRIBUTING.md) and let people install it!  

### How To Install
- Download the `main.py` file.
- If you are on a unix-like OS (eg. MacOS, Linux), you can edit your `.bashrc` file or `.zshrc` file by adding the line `alias pyopeninstall='python path/to/main.py'` and replace `path/to/main.py` with the path of the downloaded `main.py`.  ***Note: some systems use `python3` instead of `python`.***
- Start installing modules and have fun!
