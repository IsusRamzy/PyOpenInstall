### PyOpenInstall
This is an open-source Python mini package-manager to install Python packages.  
***WARNING: This is not a replacment for pip, but an `extension` for it, so you can install modules not bundled in `pip`.***
Did you find an API not included in the standard Python manager, `pip`?  
PyOpenInstall installs the API for you.  
Or you have a Python module and you want people to install it easily?
Contribute to PyOpenInstall and let people install it!
